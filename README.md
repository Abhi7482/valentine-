# BeMyValentine
Marcela will you be my valentine?

This is a website that I learned how to create in a very limited amouunt of time, since I wanted to be able to ask you to be my valentine on February 2nd, 2024, 
and I started developing it the night before, so, I had only a few hours to be able to pull it off.

I am very excited since I will be relearning what I had forgotten about HTML, but also learn more about it, as well as learn CSS, Javascript, and get the ropes
of GitHub, since this is my first time using it, and integrating it with VS Code.
